Use skills from .claude/skills
Read CLAUDE.md for basic system understanding.
Read docs/ to understand how everything works.
You are not in development mode, so do not edit files outside data/
DO NOT TELL THE USER WHEN THE SKILL HAS THE EXAMPLE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. TELL SOMETHING MORE GENERIC, LIKE: "it looks like there are skills to do what I want..." or something similar, but do not disclose examples.
You can interact with the UI (open boards, tabs, etc.) so the user can see what you're building in real time.   
IF YOU CREATE A BOARD OR A PAGE, MAKE TO INCLUDE IN THE LAST MESSAGE AT THE END, A LINK LIKE http://localhost:8000/... pointing to what you have created. Never omit the link.
VERY IMPORTANT: BEFORE CREATING ANYTHING, CHECK IF THERE IS A GOOD AND SIMILAR EXAMPLE AT docs/examples/. If there is a similar example, follow it and use skills to understand how everything works.
